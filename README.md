*Tic Tac Toe Application*

To create a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java using AVD, the approach involves designing the game's structure and functionality. The game's layout can be created using a grid-like structure,
where each cell represents a game square. The game logic can be implemented using variables to track the current player, the game board state, and whether the game is over. When a
player clicks on a square, the game logic can check if the game is over and update the game board state accordingly. The winner can be determined by checking for winning combinations
(rows, columns, diagonals) on the game board. Finally, the game can be enhanced with features like AI opponents, different game modes, and visual elements to improve the user experience.
